## Story & history

Cotopia started as a small design studio shipping templates to help startups and indie makers launch faster. Over time we focused on reusable components, accessible patterns, and a small shop to distribute digital products directly to customers.

We aim to keep the catalog focused and avoid feature bloat — fewer, higher-quality items that are easy to adopt.
